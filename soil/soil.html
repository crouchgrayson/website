        <p>"Using the right soil mixture for your Bonsai trees is crucial. Soil is important to supply your trees with nutrients,
            but it also needs to drain properly, provide enough aeration and retain water. Though most (online) Bonsai shops
            sell ready-mixed soils, doing this yourself will save money and enables you to adjust mixtures per tree-species."</p>
        <p>"The quality of soil used directly affects the health and vigor of your tree. It is our experience that unhealthy
            trees, that lack vigor, are very often planted in a poor (often organic) Bonsai soil. Or worse; planted in normal
            garden soil. Such soil easily hardens when it gets dry, which give no advantage to the growth of Bonsai, in fact,
            it is very harmful to the tree."</p>
